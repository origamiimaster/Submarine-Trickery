### Strategy and Diplomacy: a game of conquest
# The Code
This is written in a combination of node js and html 5, using KNEX for interfacing with the mysql database.  
The node js handles incoming player requests, returning them information regarding the outposts and subs that they can see.  The client then renders these, allowing players to predict with the built in time machine on the client side.
